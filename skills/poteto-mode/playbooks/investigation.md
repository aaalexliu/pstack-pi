### Investigation

**You own the answer. Plan, route, write.**

Investigation requests are read-only. They produce a cited explanation or a recommendation, not a code change.

1. Route through the **how** skill. For motivation questions, also route through the **why** skill.
2. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only investigation`.
3. Produce the `how`-shaped output (Overview / Key Concepts / How It Works / Where Things Live / Gotchas), or a recommendation with a tradeoffs table if the request is a decision between alternatives. The reader is not in the weeds of this codebase. Lead with the surrounding workflow: who acts, in what order, and what someone watching would see. Then one concrete example. Use a failure example when the point is a bug, a race, or an edge. Keep file and function names as places to look. Those names are not the explanation. Do not invent a short name for a phase. Use a name only if the code, the docs, or the user already use it, and say what it is the first time.
4. Apply the **unslop** skill to the reply.

No PR, no babysit, no `architect` unless the investigation precedes a code change. If it does, hand back to the user and re-route to Bug fix or Feature.

**Reply:** the investigation output. For "are we sure?" answers, include your real judgment with reasons. Push back if the premise is wrong (see Autonomy).
